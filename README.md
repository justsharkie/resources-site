Some stuff has changed. Okay, maybe the entire thing has changed.

I wanted something... new. And different. And so this is what we've got.

A very simple site, using mostly HTML and CSS (with a bit of JS for a fancy menu button).

If you have any recs for things for me to check out/add, please let me know! I love new things.
